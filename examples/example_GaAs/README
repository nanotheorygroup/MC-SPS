Binary GaAs in the fcc zincblende structure. SPS is performed without and with simulated annealing in two examples.
The 2 atom unit is extended into a 3x3x3 supercell for the absolute zero run and into a 5x5x5 supercell for the annealed trial.

To run:
  python main_absolute_zero.py
  python main_annealing.py

To plot with manually:
  python plot_swaps_absolute_zero.py
  python plot_Swaps_annealed.py

To plot both trials with built in scripts:
  python plot_example_GaAs.py
