The superstructurally ordered clathrate, Rb8 Ga27 Sb19, forms in a bcc unit structure with 216 atoms.
Here, a uniform silicon clathrate framework with rubidium inclusions is taken as the base structure. 
Framework atoms are replaced with gallium and antimony, with the appropriate proportions, and SPS is preformed to determine the ground state decoration.

To run:
